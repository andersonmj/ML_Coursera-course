# ML_Udacity-course
This is the repository of my class notes and exercises for the Machine Learning Foundations in Coursera by the University of Washington (https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations). Each week's coursework and quizes will be uploaded. 

The language used to work in this course is Python 2 and I'm using Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) to write, run and store my code. 

For this course we are given a one year Coursera student license of GraphLab by Turi (https://turi.com/) . GraphLab facilites getting the hang of programming models thanks to the amazing tools they have. Thank you Turin!

Week 1 is not uploaded because it's a simple review of Python basics and the first examples on how to use Graph Lab.
