# ML_Udacity-course
This is the repository for the Machine Learning Foundations in Udacity by the University of Washington. Each week's coursework and quizes will be uploaded. 

The language used to work in this course is Python 2 and I'm using Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) to write, run and store my code. 

For this course we are given a one year Coursera student license of GraphLab by Turi (https://turi.com/) . GraphLab facilites getting the hang of programming models for begginer levels thanks to the amazing tools they have. Thank you Turin!

Week 1 is not uploaded because it's a simple review of Python basics and the first examples on how to use Graph Lab. 
The databases we use are also provided by the teachers and we don't modify them to guarantee that each student will get approximately the same result.
