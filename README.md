# ML_Udacity-course
This is the repository for the Machine Learning Foundations in Udacity by the University of Washington. Each week's coursework and quizes will be uploaded.

For this course we are given a very generous one year Coursera student license of GraphLab by Turi. Graph Lab facilites getting the hang of programming models for begginer levels thanks to the amazing tools they have. 

Week 1 is not uploaded because it's a simple review of Python basics and the first examples on how to use Graph Lab.
